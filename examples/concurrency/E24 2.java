//Exercise 24: (1) Solve a single-producer, single-consumer problem using wait( ) and notifyAll( ).
// The producer must not overflow the receiverâ€™s buffer, which can happen if the producer is faster
// than the consumer. If the consumer is faster than the producer,
// then it must not read the same data more than once. Do not assume anything about
// the relative speeds of the producer or consumer.
